## Usage
In order to run the test suite successfully, go to the `GW2APITestVariables.swift` file and set the language you want to test with. Also, you must add a `test_data.json` file with the following structure to the `Tests` directory:
```json
{
"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
"GUILD_ID": "YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE"
}
```
